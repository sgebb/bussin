# bussin

A zero-backend, installable tool for interacting with Azure Service Bus. Runs entirely in your browser with no server required.

## üöÄ Use the app

**[https://bussin.dev/](https://bussin.dev/)**

Can be installed as a Progressive Web App (PWA) for offline access.

## Features

### Message Operations

- **Peek Messages** - Non-destructive message viewing with batch loading
- **Send Messages** - Send messages to queues and topics with custom properties
- **Send Scheduled Messages** - Schedule messages for future delivery
- **Delete Messages** - Lock and delete specific messages by sequence number
- **Batch Operations** - Select and process multiple messages at once
- **Dead Letter Queue Support** - View, resubmit, and manage DLQ messages
- **Purge Operations** - Clear all messages from queues or subscriptions

### Resource Management

- **Browse Resources** - View all Service Bus namespaces in your Azure subscriptions
- **Entity Explorer** - Navigate queues, topics, and subscriptions
- **Recent Namespaces** - Quick access to frequently used namespaces

### User Experience

- **Dark Mode** - Toggle between light and dark themes
- **Installable PWA** - Install as a desktop or mobile app
- **Client-Side Only** - No backend server, all operations run in your browser
- **Secure** - Your credentials never leave your browser

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

This is a **100% client-side application** built with:

- **Blazor WebAssembly** - .NET running in the browser via WebAssembly
- **MSAL.js** - Microsoft Authentication Library for Azure AD
- **Azure Management API** - For discovering Service Bus resources
- **AMQP over WebSockets** - Direct Service Bus message operations via [rhea](https://github.com/amqp/rhea)

### Why Client-Side Only?

- **No server costs** - Hosted as static files on GitHub Pages
- **No backend to secure** - Your tokens stay in your browser
- **Transparent & auditable** - All code is open source
- **Works offline** - Can be installed as PWA
- **Fast** - Direct connection to Service Bus, no server round-trips

## üîí Security & Privacy

- **Your credentials never leave your browser** - Authentication tokens are stored in browser memory only
- **No telemetry** - We don't track anything
- **Open source** - Audit the code yourself
- **Build verification** - Each deployment includes a commit hash proving it matches the source code

## Build Verification

Every deployment to GitHub Pages includes build metadata:

1. Open the deployed app
2. Open browser DevTools ‚Üí Console
3. Look for: `Build Info: Commit <hash> built at <timestamp>`
4. Verify the commit hash matches the latest commit on GitHub

You can also check `buildinfo.json` at the root of the deployed site.

## üìã Roadmap & TODO

### üöÄ Ready to Start

- [ ] **Confirm-modal on purge** - Add confirmation dialog before purging queues/subscriptions
- [ ] **General code improvements** - Refactor to be more modular, separate business logic into services, improve component structure
- [ ] **UI: Better light/dark mode color schemes** - More consistent and polished color palette across themes
- [ ] **UI: Introduce component framework** - Evaluate Blazorize/MudBlazor for better component consistency and easier theme management
- [ ] **UI: Maybe Tailwind?** - Consider migrating to Tailwind CSS for more flexible styling
- [ ] **Include underlying TypeScript code** - Integrate `servicebusapi.ts` into this repository and build/publish as part of the same process instead of separate project

### üêõ Bugs & Issues

- [ ] **Message scheduling verification** - Verify scheduling actually works, add UI to show number of scheduled messages
- [ ] **Monitor: broken** - Investigate and fix monitor functionality
- [ ] **MoveDLQ: sometimes fails** - Debug and fix reliability issues with moving messages from/to DLQ

### üé® UX Improvements

- [ ] **Find namespace UX** - Redesign navigation: home page shows favorites/recents, "Discover" button opens modal for finding new namespaces
- [ ] **Queue/topic/subscription display** - Optimize information density - currently too cluttered but need all necessary information visible

### üîÆ Future / Blocked

- [ ] **Upgrade to .NET 10** - Migrate from current .NET version to .NET 10 (when released/stable)
- [ ] **Verified publisher in Entra ID** - Complete Microsoft verification process for the app registration
- [ ] **Consider ads/donate button** - Evaluate monetization options (depends on hosting model, may require Azure Static Web Apps, consider tax implications for foreign income in Norway)
